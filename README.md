1) Select campsites within 200ft of the trails in ROMO and print out the names.
2) Select campsites within 100ft of Bear Lake Loop Trail.
3) Create an object of the Route Class for each day of your trip; you decide how far to travel each day, but you must camp at a designated site, so the daily route needs to end at a campsite or trail head.
4) Use the Total Miles Traveled method on each of your new classes to determine the number of miles traveled each day and report the distance in a print() statement.
